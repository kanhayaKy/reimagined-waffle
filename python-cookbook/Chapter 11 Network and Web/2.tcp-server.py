One issue with forking and threaded servers is that they spawn a new process or thread
on each client connection. There is no upper bound on the number of allowed clients,
so a malicious hacker could potentially launch a large number of simultaneous con‚Äê
nections in an effort to make your server explode.

Solution : use a threaded pool of servers
