# Your program uses threads and you want to lock critical sections of code to avoid race conditions

"""
A Lock guarantees mutual exclusion when used with the with statementâ€”that is, only
one thread is allowed to execute the block of statements under the with statement at a
time. The with statement acquires the lock for the duration of the indented statements
and releases the lock when control flow exits the indented block.
